"Everyday there's a new main character on Twitter, the objective is to not be it."

Data Analysis:
The objective of this project is to archive the most 'popular' tweets of the day. 
The first step is to pull the most popular tweets based on number of replies, retweets (quoted&unquoted) and likes. 
Identifying and tracking the trends in specific geolocations across the United States and expanding to other locations would be the next step. Inside those specific trends being able to rank tweets from previous criteria. 

Presentation in a static site as app is under developement. Would show data from previous day, could be used as a year in review.
